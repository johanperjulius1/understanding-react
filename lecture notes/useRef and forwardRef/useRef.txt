useRef - data not rendered. Is for storing data, like useState, but not triggering a rerender.
Like all hooks, useRef means there is going to be an object attached to a fibertree node.

useref does not return a value and a function, it returns an object.

that object has a current property. The value will be what ever you pass to useRef function call.

useref and the dom:
the most common useCase:

buttonRef will store a value to the real actual dom node which is not usually the
case in react with the virtual dom.

you can use it inside a useffect, and add actual dom events. SO when the component
 is finished rendering useffect runs

 only use useref when you can't figure out how to do something declaratively in react.
 The most common usecase seems to be focusing focusing a button or input field,
 after a certain event, after a statechange or after mount?
 Another example is scrolling
