Forward ref: when we want a parent component to be able to reference 
a dom element in a child component. Passing a ref as a prop.

You wrap the child component declaration, from inside the child component 
inside React.forwardRef(child component declaration, nameOfref)

So with the forward ref you use it in tandem with the useref in the parent.

in react 19 the ability to add ref as a prop is added.  
So then you dont need to wrap the child in a forward ref but you can
just pass it as a prop as you normally would.
