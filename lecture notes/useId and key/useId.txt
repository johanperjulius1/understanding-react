useId is about accesible elements.

the fieldset element represents a set of form controls 
grouped together.

you simply call the use id hook and store it in a
variable. then use that variable as a prop on the
elements you want to give an id.

Key: useId is for the user agent to better identify things
for user help tools like screen readers.

Key is instead for react. More specifically to help
react be as efficient as possible when deciding
what the dom updates should be during the running
of the reconciliation algorithm.

Whenever we generate jsx in a loop a unique key prop
is required.
