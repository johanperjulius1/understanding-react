use is not a hook. It can be used in loops and if statements.

Use is recommended to use with a data fetching library.

The use() hook is used to unwrap promises (and other resources) directly in components. 
It's mainly designed for React Server Components (RSC), but it can be used in the client 
in certain cases too (e.g., with suspense).

✨ Key Use Cases:
1. Unwrapping a promise directly in a component (server or suspense-enabled client):

const data = use(fetchData());
React will suspend the component until the promise resolves.

No need for useEffect + useState boilerplate.

2. Works with Promise, context, and resources:
Can be used to unwrap:

Promises

Async context

React resources (like cache())

⚠️ Important Notes:
It can only be used at the top level of a component (just like other hooks).

It requires React to support Suspense boundaries or be in a server component.

You should not use it inside event handlers or conditionals.

Suspend waits on a promise.

with use promises need to be cached, and react recommends using a library for that.
