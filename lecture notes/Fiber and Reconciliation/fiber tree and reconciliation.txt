Fiber tree is used to store state.
Is a middle man between dom and element tree. 

Is used to store information and determine what needs to be done.

reconciliation = compare two items, find the differences between them and make them equal.

tree reconciliation = comparing two trees and finding the steps needed to make them match.

tree edit distance problem = what is the algorithm to find the smallest number of steps 
to change one tree to make it look like the other.

algorithm = a step by step procedure for solving a problem or computing something

the fiber tree matches the current tree of the dom
the react element tree is the developer telling react how we want the dom to appear

if the element tree is a blueprint
the element tree is like a small model of the house where we can test how to make the chamges
in the most efficient way possible.

the work in process branch however matches the latest element tree.

reconciliation and work:
react takes current tree and the work-in-progress-tree and applies a reconciliation algorithm.
this decides out what steps to take on the real tree.
