Sometimes we need side effects in code - we need functions to be 
able to changes things outside of itself.

The issue isn't really side effects, rather when the side
effects happen.

react is smart enough so that useEffect only runs after the
component has rendered / after react has finished every thing
else.

Hooks are objects attached to fiber nodes.
