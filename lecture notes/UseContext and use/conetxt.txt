start with createContext.
context is just an object returned from createContext.

that object has a current value, a Consumer and a Provider.

the way to put state in the fiber tree is with NameOfContext.Provider passing it a value.
The state is then available to any of its descendants.

The way to use it is with a hook. You call useContext(NameOfContext).

Propagation stops if there is another provider further down in the tree.

use accepts a promise or calls readContext
Now when we wrap applications we don't need to use NameOfContext.Provider
just NameOfContext is enough. And instead of useContext we do just use
