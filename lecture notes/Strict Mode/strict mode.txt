strict mode in react is a node in the fiber tree.
When react finds one, all of its descendants 
all of its descendants will be considered in strict mode.

you dont need to have the whole app in strict mode,
you can make just certain components in strict.

What really happens is that when reacts finds 
the strict component it runs some extra code.

the purpose of strict mode is about avoiding
mistakes.

two main purpose:
1. extra rerender
 it runs an extra rerender of each of its descendants
 components. the purpose is to find functions that
 arent pure.



2. extra effect re run / cleaning up effects.
Strict mode only runs in dev mode
Extra effect rerun might help us find if we are
missing a cleanup.
