useState is a specialised version of useReducer.-
useState will call a reducer function with the argument as an action, but the state will be
set equal to the value of the action.

Immutable state...
Two places where react needs to immutable:
Props and state as used in useReducer and useState.

React doesn't do shallow equality. It checks
if state still refers to the same location in memory,
so if you only mutate state and not replace it,
react won't notice and rerender.

Props and state are compared referentially.
We don't change state, we create new copies and 
store them at new locations in memory.
This helps reacts diffchecking algorithm.
