How think regarding state of submission of form?

I need form input and action buttons to work together so
best is to place submission logic and state in the shared parent
Game controls.

1: start with form logic

1st: if shorter than four characters it shall be red
2nd: if contains letter that is not allowed borders shall be red
3rd: if not containing centerletter it shall be red
